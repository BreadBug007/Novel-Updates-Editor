Update and edit novel status on NovelUpdates

## How To Use

Open cmd in the directory where the file is saved and run this script:

    - chapter is the chapter until where you've read the novel
```

- Include novels whose chapters have format anything else than "c123", like "v1c2".
- Add options to add a novel to reading or other lists.
