# Novel-Updates-Editor

Update and edit novel status on NovelUpdates

## How To Use

Open cmd in the directory where the file is saved and run this script:
> python Novel_Updates_Basic.py username/email password "novel_name" chapter
```
    - novel_name should be in quotes to avoid wrong search
    - chapter is the chapter until where you've read the novel
```


## To-Do

- [ ] ~~Make search group general, instead of just Wuxiaworld.~~
- [ ] Removed group based search in basic version, making it search based on the chapter number and finding that chapter in the novel directory.
- [ ] Include novels whose chapters have format anything else than "c123", like "v1c2".
- [ ] Add options to add/remove a novel to reading or other lists or other random tasks.
- [ ] Include wait times.
- [ ] A hell lot more
